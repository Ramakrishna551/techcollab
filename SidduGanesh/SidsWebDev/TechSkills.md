Git (local tool for distributed version controlling) - GitHub (hosting server for git repositories.)

Docker - DockerRegistry/DockerHub(hub.docker.com)
A docker registry contains a lot of repositories
different versions of different applications.
Since Docker Hub is a public registry,
anybody can access it.
Typically, when we work in an enterprise
we use private repositories
so that our application images are only accessed
by people who have the right access to it.
